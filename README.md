# A Minimum (might not be) Python (Distribution) Package

This repo is only for practice, no practical usage.

## Environtment

- python 3.12
- venv for Virtual Environment
- edit (on cmd) as editor

install package:
1. build

## Hint

1. The name of the package directoy in `src/` is inconsistent with that in the distribution package and so does the module `harmonic`.
This might be confusing and not conventional, but it provides an insight when it comes to **referencing** files, paths, etc. Anyway this repo is for
practice only, it'd be better to make everything clear.
